#### Historic Fortifications and Urban Planning

Luxembourg City's Old Quarters and Fortifications, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, showcase over 1,000 years of military architecture and urban development. The city's dramatic topography, with the old city perched on cliffs above the Alzette and Pétrusse valleys, created natural defensive advantages that were enhanced by successive generations of military engineers.

Historic highlights include:

  * **Chemin de la Corniche:** "Europe's most beautiful balcony" promenade
  * **Grand Ducal Palace:** Official residence of the Grand Duke
