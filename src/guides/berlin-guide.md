**Autumn (September-October):** Comfortable temperatures and cultural season beginnings, with fewer tourists and excellent conditions for museum visits.
**Winter (November-February):** Christmas markets and indoor cultural activities, though weather can be cold and daylight hours are limited.


### Transportation and Logistics
